#Plant Growth Monitoring System
#Project Overview
This project aims to develop an image processing system for monitoring plant growth in controlled environments using Python, OpenCV, and Matplotlib. The system captures time-lapse images of plants and analyzes growth patterns, leaf count, and health indicators through automated image processing techniques.

#Project Description
The system addresses the challenge of manual and subjective plant monitoring by automating the process through:

Time-lapse image acquisition in controlled environments

Image pre-processing and segmentation

Growth pattern and health indicator analysis

#Features

Noise reduction and contrast enhancement

Plant region segmentation using thresholding and edge detection

Quantitative analysis of Health of leaves and growth patterns

#Visualization of growth trends using Matplotlib

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

OpenCV (for image processing)

Matplotlib (for data visualization)

NumPy (for numerical operations)
